# Railway Transportation System

## Project Description
The Railway Transportation System is designed to manage train transportation services, including passenger registration, train management, ticket reservation, and payment processing.  
This system allows passengers to search for trains, book tickets, and manage their reservations while administrators manage trains, stations, and reports.

## Features
- Passenger registration and login
- Train search by source and destination
- Train schedule viewing
- Ticket booking
- Ticket cancellation
- Seat availability checking
- Payment processing
- Ticket generation
- Admin management for trains and stations
- Report generation

## System Actors
### Passenger
Passengers can:
- Register and login
- Search for trains
- View train schedules
- Book tickets
- Cancel tickets
- View ticket details

### Admin
Administrators can:
- Manage trains
- Manage stations
- View passenger data
- Generate system reports

## System Components

### Passenger
Stores passenger information such as:
- ID
- Name
- Phone number
- Email

### Train
